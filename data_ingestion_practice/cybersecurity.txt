Cybersecurity: An Overview
---------------------------

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Types of Cyber Threats:
1. Malware - Software designed to damage or destroy a computer system.
2. Phishing - Fraudulent emails designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information.
3. Ransomware - Malware that locks files and demands payment for release.
4. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks - Where attackers secretly intercept communication between two parties.
5. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks - Overwhelming systems to make them unavailable to users.

Key Principles of Cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that data is not accessed by unauthorized individuals.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

Best Practices:
- Use strong, unique passwords and update them regularly.
- Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.
- Keep software and systems updated.
- Regularly back up important data.
- Educate users about social engineering and phishing scams.

Conclusion:
Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. From individuals to large organizations, everyone has a role in securing the digital environment. Awareness, best practices, and the right technologies help minimize the risk of cyber threats.
