## ðŸ§  Basic Workflow in LangGraph

LangGraph operates using a graph-based structure where tasks are broken down into logical components. The basic workflow includes the following key elements:

### ðŸ”¹ Nodes

* Represent the core logic or **individual tasks** to be executed.
* Each node performs a specific function in the pipeline (e.g., querying a model, filtering input, etc.).

### ðŸ”¹ Edges

* **Connect the nodes**, establishing the flow of data and execution.
* Control the direction and logic of the graphâ€™s traversal.

### ðŸ”¹ State

* Acts as the **data structure** passed between nodes.
* It contains all inputs and outputs and evolves over time as it moves through the graph.
* Defined using a **state schema** (like a Pydantic model).

### ðŸ”¹ StateGraph

* Represents the **entire structure** of the graph.
* Combines all nodes, edges, and state transitions into a cohesive workflow.
